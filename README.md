# TASK TRACKER SERVER

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

> Task Tracker Server Is a restful api server written in NodeJs (ES5/ES6). In this project I try to follow _best practices_ as informed by my experience writing production servers using **Golang** but wary of NodeJS(javascript) gotchas. This server aims to provide a restful api to the tasktracker client.

**NOTE** _best practices_ is a very subjective term. Please feel free to insert your own meaning as you see fit and as it fits your usecase.

## Requirements

- NodeJS (latest stable version).
- Npm (comes preinstalled with nodejs installation).
- Curiosity. (Bring your own curiosity).

## How To Run

`npm start`
